Okay, let's focus exclusively on building out the backend first: `parsedmarc` for processing and Elasticsearch/OpenSearch as your "mind server" for data storage and API. This will give you a solid API to build your frontend upon.

**Core Logic:**

1.  **`parsedmarc` (The DMARC Data Harvester):**
    * **Role:** Its primary job is to connect to an email inbox (IMAP) where DMARC aggregate reports (XML files) are sent by various email providers (Gmail, Outlook, etc.).
    * **Logic:**
        * Fetches the raw XML reports.
        * Parses the XML into a structured, standardized JSON format. This means extracting sender domains, source IPs, SPF results, DKIM results, DMARC policy (none, quarantine, reject), disposition, alignment, and other relevant DMARC metrics.
        * Pushes these structured JSON documents into Elasticsearch/OpenSearch.
    * **Continuous Operation:** It's designed to run continuously (`--continuous`) or periodically, checking for new reports and processing them as they arrive.

2.  **Elasticsearch / OpenSearch (The "Mind Server" - Data Storage & API):**
    * **Role:** This is where all your parsed DMARC data will live. It's a powerful search and analytics engine that provides a RESTful API. This is the **API you will integrate with your frontend.**
    * **Logic:**
        * **Indexing:** When `parsedmarc` sends data, Elasticsearch/OpenSearch indexes it, making it searchable very quickly.
        * **Data Structure:** `parsedmarc` sends data in a consistent schema. For example, each DMARC aggregate report becomes a document, and within that, there are nested fields for records, policy evaluation, source IPs, etc.
        * **Querying (Your API):** You can send HTTP GET/POST requests to Elasticsearch/OpenSearch's API endpoints to:
            * Retrieve raw DMARC records.
            * Filter records based on any field (e.g., `source_ip`, `header_from`, `disposition`).
            * Aggregate data (e.g., count failures by domain, sum message volumes, calculate pass rates over time, group by source IP).
            * Perform time-series analysis (e.g., trends over the last 7 days).
    * **API Endpoints:** Elasticsearch/OpenSearch exposes standard REST API endpoints (e.g., `/_search`, `/_msearch`, `/_count`) that accept JSON queries in the request body.

**Key Integration Point:** `parsedmarc` is configured to output directly to an Elasticsearch/OpenSearch host and port. Your frontend will then make HTTP requests to the exposed port of that same Elasticsearch/OpenSearch instance.

### Logic Flow for Backend Setup

1.  **Define Services:** Use `docker-compose.yml` to define two main services: `elasticsearch` (or `opensearch`) and `parsedmarc`.
2.  **Configure `parsedmarc`:** Provide the IMAP credentials and point `parsedmarc` to the `elasticsearch` service name.
3.  **Persistence:** Use Docker volumes to ensure Elasticsearch data is saved even if the container restarts.
4.  **Network:** Docker Compose automatically creates a network, allowing `parsedmarc` to communicate with `elasticsearch` using their service names.
5.  **Health Checks:** Include health checks in `docker-compose.yml` to ensure services start in the correct order and are ready.

### Prompts / Actionable Steps (Local Backend Setup)

Let's assume you're in your `dmarc-analyzer-local` directory.

**Prompt 1: Define Your Backend Services in `docker-compose.yml`**

Create or update your `docker-compose.yml` to include only the `elasticsearch` and `parsedmarc` services. I'm also including `kibana` here because it's invaluable for *verifying* your backend API and data without writing any frontend code yet.

```yaml
# dmarc-analyzer-local/docker-compose.yml
version: '3.8'

services:
  elasticsearch:
    image: docker.elastic.co/elasticsearch/elasticsearch:7.17.9
    container_name: dmarc_backend_elasticsearch
    environment:
      - discovery.type=single-node
      - ES_JAVA_OPTS=-Xms512m -Xmx1g # Adjust RAM if needed (e.g., -Xmx2g for more)
      - xpack.security.enabled=false # IMPORTANT: Keep false for local testing. Enable for production!
    ports:
      - "9200:9200" # Expose Elasticsearch API to your host machine
    volumes:
      - esdata:/usr/share/elasticsearch/data # Persistent data storage
    restart: unless-stopped
    healthcheck:
      test: ["CMD-SHELL", "curl -f http://localhost:9200/_cluster/health?wait_for_status=yellow || exit 1"]
      interval: 10s
      timeout: 10s
      retries: 5

  kibana: # Your direct API verification tool
    image: docker.elastic.co/kibana/kibana:7.17.9
    container_name: dmarc_backend_kibana
    environment:
      - ELASTICSEARCH_HOSTS=http://elasticsearch:9200 # Communicate using the service name
    ports:
      - "5601:5601" # Expose Kibana to your host machine
    depends_on:
      elasticsearch:
        condition: service_healthy
    restart: unless-stopped
    healthcheck:
      test: ["CMD-SHELL", "curl -f http://localhost:5601/api/status || exit 1"]
      interval: 10s
      timeout: 10s
      retries: 5

  parsedmarc:
    image: ghcr.io/domainaware/parsedmarc:latest
    container_name: dmarc_backend_parsedmarc
    volumes:
      - ./config/parsedmarc.ini:/etc/parsedmarc.ini:ro # Mount your config file
    command: ["-c", "/etc/parsedmarc.ini", "--continuous", "--no-email-log"] # Run parsedmarc continuously
    depends_on:
      elasticsearch:
        condition: service_healthy # Ensure Elasticsearch is ready to receive data
    restart: unless-stopped

volumes:
  esdata: # Define the Docker volume for Elasticsearch
```

**Prompt 2: Configure `parsedmarc`'s IMAP Connection**

Update your `config/parsedmarc.ini` with your actual IMAP details for where you receive DMARC aggregate reports.

```ini
# dmarc-analyzer-local/config/parsedmarc.ini
[general]
save_aggregate = True
save_forensic = True

[imap]
host = your_imap_server.com  # e.g., imap.mail.com
user = dmarc_reports@yourdomain.com
password = YOUR_IMAP_PASSWORD_HERE # Replace this!
ssl = True
port = 993 # Or 143 if not SSL
watch = True
delete_reports = False

[elasticsearch]
host = elasticsearch # Keep this as 'elasticsearch' - it refers to the service name in docker-compose.yml
port = 9200
ssl = False
verify_certs = False
```

**Prompt 3: Spin Up Your Backend Services**

Open your terminal in the `dmarc-analyzer-local/` directory and run:

```bash
docker compose up -d
```

**Prompt 4: Verify Backend Health and Data Ingestion**

1.  **Check Container Status:**
    ```bash
    docker compose ps
    ```
    All services (`elasticsearch`, `kibana`, `parsedmarc`) should show `Up`.
2.  **Monitor `parsedmarc` Logs:**
    ```bash
    docker compose logs -f parsedmarc
    ```
    You should see messages indicating it's connecting to your IMAP server, fetching XML reports, parsing them, and sending them to Elasticsearch. Look for "Sent aggregate report to Elasticsearch" or similar.
3.  **Access Kibana to Verify Data:**
    * Open your browser to `http://localhost:5601`.
    * If this is your first time, Kibana will ask you to set up an index pattern. Enter `parsedmarc-*` and select `@timestamp` as the time field.
    * Go to the "Discover" section in Kibana. You should see parsed DMARC records appearing. This confirms your "mind server" is receiving data.

### Prompts / Logic for API Interaction (Once Data is Flowing)

Now that data is in Elasticsearch, you can interact with its API. Your frontend will perform these types of HTTP requests.

**Prompt 5: Retrieve All DMARC Records (Basic Query)**

You can use `curl` (or Postman, Insomnia, browser developer tools) to hit the Elasticsearch API.

```bash
curl -X GET "http://localhost:9200/parsedmarc-*/_search?pretty" -H "Content-Type: application/json" -d'
{
  "query": {
    "match_all": {}
  },
  "size": 10 # Get the first 10 documents
}
'
```
* `parsedmarc-*`: This is the index pattern `parsedmarc` uses (e.g., `parsedmarc-aggregate-2025.06.01`). The `*` matches all such indices.
* `_search`: The Elasticsearch search API endpoint.
* `pretty`: Makes the JSON output readable.
* `match_all`: A query that matches all documents.
* `size`: Limits the number of results.

**Prompt 6: Filter Records (e.g., Show Failures)**

This query finds all records where the DMARC `disposition` was 'quarantine' or 'reject'.

```bash
curl -X GET "http://localhost:9200/parsedmarc-*/_search?pretty" -H "Content-Type: application/json" -d'
{
  "query": {
    "bool": {
      "should": [
        { "match": { "policy_evaluated.disposition": "quarantine" } },
        { "match": { "policy_evaluated.disposition": "reject" } }
      ],
      "minimum_should_match": 1
    }
  },
  "size": 50
}
'
```

**Prompt 7: Aggregate Data (e.g., Count Messages by Disposition)**

This is where Elasticsearch shines for analytics. You can use **aggregations** to get summary data, which is perfect for charts on your frontend.

```bash
curl -X GET "http://localhost:9200/parsedmarc-*/_search?pretty" -H "Content-Type: application/json" -d'
{
  "size": 0, # Don't return documents, just aggregations
  "aggs": {
    "disposition_counts": {
      "terms": {
        "field": "policy_evaluated.disposition.keyword", # .keyword for exact string matching
        "size": 10
      }
    }
  }
}
'
```
* You'd get a JSON response like:
    ```json
    "aggregations": {
      "disposition_counts": {
        "doc_count_error_upper_bound": 0,
        "sum_other_doc_count": 0,
        "buckets": [
          {
            "key": "none",
            "doc_count": 12345
          },
          {
            "key": "quarantine",
            "doc_count": 567
          },
          {
            "key": "reject",
            "doc_count": 89
          }
        ]
      }
    }
    ```
    This is exactly the kind of data you'd use for a pie chart of DMARC disposition percentages.

**Prompt 8: Time-Series Aggregation (e.g., Messages Over Time)**

For line charts showing trends.

```bash
curl -X GET "http://localhost:9200/parsedmarc-*/_search?pretty" -H "Content-Type: application/json" -d'
{
  "size": 0,
  "aggs": {
    "messages_over_time": {
      "date_histogram": {
        "field": "@timestamp",
        "interval": "day", # Can be "hour", "week", "month"
        "format": "yyyy-MM-dd"
      }
    }
  },
  "query": {
    "range": {
      "@timestamp": {
        "gte": "now-7d/d", # Last 7 days, rounded down to the day
        "lte": "now/d"
      }
    }
  }
}
'
```
* This will give you buckets for each day, with a `doc_count` for that day, ideal for a line chart showing daily DMARC traffic.

---

By completing these steps, you'll have a robust backend running locally, providing a flexible API through Elasticsearch. You can then confidently start building your frontend, knowing exactly how to query and consume the DMARC data.
